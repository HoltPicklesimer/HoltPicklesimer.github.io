Producktivo is a productivity app that gamifies tasks to give users more motivation to work on said tasks. Producktivo tracks task status, due dates, and when tasks are completed and started. Users can sign up for an account using their email and a password and all of their information and tasks are stored in a Firebase database. Users can view their tasks coming up within a month on the main task page, where they can also create new tasks, start and complete tasks, view individual task details, and delete tasks. Users can filter their tasks on the task page by tasks they still need to do, tasks not started, tasks started, tasks completed, or all tasks. When creating or editing a task, users can set the task difficulty to easy, medium, or hard, which determines the amount of points the user earns after completing the task. As users earn points for completing tasks, they grow in level, which can be viewed on their stats page. Users can view the total amount of time it takes to complete tasks and the average amount of time it takes for them to complete a single task on the stats page as well. From the settings page, users can reset their email and password or logout of the app. It is downloadable on the Google Play Store"},{id:1,title:"CareSource",subTitle:"Full-Time Internship",imgSrc:P.a,selected:!1,content:"While working at CareSource for the past year and a half, I worked on internal tools and bugfixes for the Enrollment team that handles incoming member records.One project I have worked on was the Enrollment Engine Regression Testing Tool.
